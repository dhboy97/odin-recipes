              <li>1 tbsp of corn starch</li>
              <li>Salt</li>

              <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
              <li>1 tbsp of butter</li>
              <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
              <li>2 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
              <li>1/4 cup of honey</li>
              <li>1/4 cup of chicken broth</li>
              <li>Green onion</li>
              <li>Black or white sesame seeds</li>

            </ul>
          
          <h3>Directions</h3>  
            <ol>
              <li>Cut the excess fat off of the chicken breasts and cut them into bite sized pieces. Put the pieces into a bowl and add 1 tbsp of corn starch. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix eveything together until the ingregients are evenly spread over the surface of the chicken.</li>
              <li>Put a medium sized pan on the stove and heat it to medium heat. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter to the pan. Once the butter and oil are heated, add the chicken pieces to the pan and raise heat to medium/high. Make sure not to over fill the pan, give the chicken pieces room to breathe. Cook until both sides are golden brown. This should take about 3-5 minutes per side. Once the chicken is cooked, put the pieces into another bowl. </li> 
              <li>Once all of the chicken is cooked, lower stove heat to medium and add 1 clove of minced or crushed garlic. Sautee garlic for about 1 minute. After this, add 2 tbsp of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of chicken broth, and 1/4 cup of honey. Mix ingredients in the pan and allow the sauce to reduce until it is thick. This should take about 5 minutes. </li>
              <li>After the sauce has reduced, lower stove heat to low. Take the cooked chicken from the bowl and mix together with the sauce in the pan until the sauce is evenly distributed on the chicken.</li>
              <li>Serve chicken by itself or on rice. Garnish with green onion and sesame seeds to taste.</li>

            </ol>
